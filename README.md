EdoCode.io - RESTful Web-services
====================

Various RESTful Web-services
-------------------

In an effort to learn more about back-end web technologies, I'm developing this suite of simple and useless web-services.

Current technology stack is the following:

Java / Spring / Maven / Tomcat / Linux / Intel NUC server

Future additions include:

NoSQL (maybe MongoDB) / Hibernate / JBoss / Jenkins (maybe)
